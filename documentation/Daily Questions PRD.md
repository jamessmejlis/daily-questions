# Daily Questions App - MVP PRD

### TL;DR

The Daily Questions app is a streamlined mobile tool for
self-improvement and habit building. Users create, answer, and track
daily reflection questions, receive customizable reminders, and monitor
progress through simple insights. The MVP is focused on solo and group
accountability without AI features, enabling fast and frictionless
experiences for individuals and small groups striving for personal
growth.

- Collect actionable feedback from at least 20 users within the first
  month.

### User Goals

- Enable users to answer and review daily questions with minimal
  friction (≤2 minutes per day).

## User Stories

### Individual Self-Improver

- As a user, I want to set and customize my own daily reflection questions, so that I can track habits that matter to me.

- As a user, I want a fast, simple interface to answer my questions each
  day, so that reflection feels effortless.

- As a user, I want to view my answering streak and trends, so that I
  can stay motivated by my progress.

- As a user, I want reminder notifications, so that I do not forget to
  answer my questions.

### Coach (Optional Future Persona)

- As a coach, I want to suggest initial reflection questions, so clients
  can start quickly. *(Note: not in MVP if prioritizing solo use.)*

### Accountability Partner (Optional/Future)

- As a user, I want to be able to view or export my summary to share
  with a partner, so that I can be accountable.

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

- Users land on a welcoming, branded splash screen.

    (limit: 6 initial).

  - Set preferred daily reminder time.

- Guided walkthrough highlights key app sections (dashboard, progress,
  settings).

**Core Experience**

- **Step 1: Open App**

  - User is greeted by today’s dashboard, showing all current questions
    in a clear, single-scroll list.

- **Step 2: Answer Questions**

  - User taps/toggles/selects answer for each question.

  - Inputs are simple: large touch targets, autosave or submit at end.

  - Can skip any question (track skipped/missed).

- **Step 3: Review and Feedback**

  - Upon completion, a “Well done!” message appears and the streak count
    is shown.

- **Step 4: Track Progress**

  - Access daily/monthly calendar or chart view of past activity from
    the dashboard.

    lines.

- **Step 5: Adjustments**

  - Users can add/remove/edit questions, change answer format, or update
    reminders at any time from the settings area.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

## Narrative

Alex is an aspiring product manager looking to build better habits and
become more self-aware. After hearing about the Daily Questions app,
Alex downloads it and signs up with Google in seconds. The onboarding
flow suggests a few meaningful questions to ask each day, such as “Did I
do my best to listen today?” and “Did I prioritize my health?”

Alex customizes one question and sets a gentle evening reminder. Each
night, Alex quickly taps through the day’s questions—using simple
toggles and fields designed for ease—feeling a small sense of
accomplishment. After a week, Alex glances at the built-in chart,
noticing a streak of five consecutive days.

Alex tweaks the questions as personal goals evolve. The daily ritual is
fast, positive, and private—no social sharing or AI, just a supportive
nudge to keep growing. After a month, Alex feels more consistent,
reflective, and in control, using the app as a touchstone for real
self-improvement.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

- Mobile-first frontend (PWA or native) for iOS and Android

- Codebase structured with a clean storage abstraction/service/layer,
  storing data on-device using SQLite, local files, or secure storage
  with no backend required for the MVP.

- All responses stored securely with encryption at rest

- Simple data model: user, question, answer, streaks

- Notifications (push for mobile, email as fallback)

- Mobile-first frontend (PWA or native) for iOS and Android

- Admin tools: ability to export anonymized usage data

### Integration Points

- OAuth for easy sign-in (Google at minimum)

- Push notification service (OneSignal or native alternatives)

- Email/SMTP integration for reminder fallback

### Scalability & Performance

- Optimized for 10,000+ users in MVP architecture

- Lightweight API/data for fast mobile experience

### Data Storage & Privacy

- All responses securely stored with encryption at rest

- Clear privacy policy: user data remains on-device unless user opts for
  additional features in future releases

- Account settings for export/deletion of all user data

### Potential Challenges

- Handling offline mode and sync conflict gracefully

- Ensuring notification reliability across platforms and OS versions

- Maintaining user privacy and adherence to privacy policy

------------------------------------------------------------------------
