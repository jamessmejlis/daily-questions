### **Project Name:**

*Daily Questions Coach*

I want to build a **personal accountability and self-reflection mobile app** that helps **individuals focused on self-improvement** track their daily answers to personal development questions and stay accountable to their goals (e.g., following Marshall Goldsmith’s Daily Questions method). It should feel **friendly, supportive, minimalist, and frictionless** and be optimized for mobile.

• Coaches and personal development enthusiasts  
• Teams or small groups wanting lightweight accountability tools
