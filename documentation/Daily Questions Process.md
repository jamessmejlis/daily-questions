#### Did I Do My Best To...

**Daily Questions**
**By Marshall Goldsmith**

The 'Daily Questions' process is a self-reflection exercise that I practice every day. It involves answering a series of questions that I have determined are crucial for living according to my values and achieving my goals. These questions are designed to keep me focused on what's important and to hold myself accountable for my actions and behaviors.

*Here's how the process works:*

1. I have a list of questions, currently 32, that I answer every day. These questions cover various aspects of my life, including happiness, engagement, relationships, health, and professional responsibilities.
2. Each question is answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'—represented by a '1' for yes and a '0' for no—or with a specific number if the question requires it (like the number of sit-ups done).
3. I record my answers on an Excel spreadsheet, which allows me to quickly see my progress and patterns over time.
4. To ensure accountability, I have someone call me almost every day to go through my answers. This person provides no negative feedback, only positive reinforcement when appropriate.

The benefits of this process are numerous:

- It encourages daily self-reflection, which is essential for personal growth.

- It helps me stay aligned with my values and ensures that I am living them out each day.

- It provides a clear and immediate feedback loop for my behaviors and actions.

- It fosters a sense of personal responsibility and control over my life.

- It helps me to be proactive rather than reactive, focusing on what I can change and letting go of what I cannot.

- It supports continuous improvement in both my personal and professional life.

By asking myself these questions daily, I am forced to confront the reality of my actions and make conscious decisions to improve. It's a powerful tool that I highly recommend to anyone looking to be their best and achieve their goals.

If you're just starting out with the 'Daily Questions' process, I recommend beginning with a few key questions that cover the basic tenets of employee engagement and personal development. These questions are also effective in other areas of life. 

*Here are the six questions I suggest for everyone, especially beginners:*

1. Did I do my best to set clear goals today?

2. Did I do my best to make progress towards my goals today?

3. Did I do my best to find meaning today?

4. Did I do my best to be happy today?

5. Did I do my best to build positive relationships today?

6. Did I do my best to be engaged today?

These questions are designed to help you reflect on your daily efforts and encourage you to take proactive steps towards self-improvement. As you become more comfortable with the process, you can add more questions that are specific to your personal and professional development goals. Remember, the number of questions is a personal choice, and you should tailor them to reflect what's most important to you.

In my 'Daily Questions' process, I track my answers over time using an Excel spreadsheet. Each day, I record my responses to the questions, which are typically answered with a 'yes' or 'no'—represented by a '1' for yes and a '0' for no—or with a specific number if the question requires it, such as the number of sit-ups done or hours of sleep.

Over time, this spreadsheet becomes a valuable data set that reflects my daily efforts and patterns. By reviewing this data regularly, I can:

1. Identify trends: I look for patterns in my behavior over time. For example, I might notice that I consistently score low on a particular question, which indicates an area where I need to focus more effort.
2. Measure progress: The data allows me to see whether I'm improving in certain areas or if I'm consistently meeting my standards for behaviors that align with my values.
3. Make adjustments: If I find that I'm not making the progress I'd like, I can use the data to make informed decisions about changes to my routines or strategies.
4. Hold myself accountable: The visual representation of my answers helps me stay accountable to myself. A string of '0's next to a question is a clear sign that I'm not living up to my own expectations in that area.
5. Reflect and recalibrate: The process of tracking and reviewing my answers prompts regular self-reflection. It helps me recalibrate my efforts and focus on what's truly important.

The data from my 'Daily Questions' is not just a record; it's a tool for continuous self-improvement. It provides a clear and objective feedback loop that helps me live my values and work towards my goals every day.
